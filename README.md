# Tandemloop-Project--t2021-2-1 
Problem1 

Step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Define a class called `Calculator`. This class will have methods for performing arithmetic operations.
2. Inside the class, define the `__init__` method (constructor) that takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. These parameters represent the operands of the calculator. The method converts `a` and `b` to float values and assigns them to instance variables `self.a` and `self.b`, respectively.
3. Define four methods inside the class: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each method performs the corresponding operation on `self.a` and `self.b` and returns the result.
4. In the `divide` method, a check is included to handle division by zero. If `self.b` is not equal to zero, the method performs the division and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.
5. Outside the class definition, prompt the user to enter the value of `a` using the `input` function. Store the input in the variable `a`.
6. Prompt the user to enter the value of `b` using the `input` function. Store the input in the variable `b`.
7. Prompt the user to enter the type of operation (+, -, *, /) using the `input` function. Store the input in the variable `operation`.
8. Create an instance of the `Calculator` class called `calculator` by calling the class with `a` and `b` as arguments. This will initialize the instance with the provided values.
9. Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine the type of operation requested by the user and perform the corresponding operation using the appropriate method of the `calculator` instance. Store the result in the variable `result`.
10. Print the result using the `print` function, along with a descriptive message.

That's it! The code will execute these steps and provide the result of the requested operation performed on the given values of `a` and `b`.


Problem-2:

Step-by-step of the code:
1. Define the function `generate_series(a)` that takes a parameter `a`.
2. Initialize an empty list called `series` to store the generated numbers.
3. Start a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to `a*2` (exclusive) with a step size of 2. This ensures that only odd numbers are included in the series. The loop variable `i` takes on the values of the odd numbers.
4. Inside the loop, append the string representation of `i` to the `series` list using the `append` method. The `str(i)` converts the integer value of `i` to a string before appending it to the list.
5. After the loop finishes, use the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `series` list into a single string. The elements will be separated by a comma and a space using `', '.join(series)`.
6. Outside the function, prompt the user to enter the value of `a` using the `input` function. Convert the input to an integer using `int()` and store it in the variable `input_value`.
7. Call the `generate_series` function with `input_value` as the argument. This will generate the series of numbers based on the input value.
8. Assign the result to the variable `output`.
9. Print the output with a descriptive message using the `print` function.

That's it! The code will execute these steps and generate a series of numbers based on the provided value of `a`.

Problem-3: 

Step-by-step of the code:

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Define a function named `generate_series` that takes an input parameter `a`.
2. Initialize an empty list named `numbers` to store the generated series.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to `a * 2` (exclusive) with a step size of 2. This ensures that only odd numbers are included in the series.
4. Inside the loop, append the current number `i` to the `numbers` list.
5. After the loop, return the `numbers` list.
6. Prompt the user to enter a value for `a` using the `input` function. The input is converted to an integer using the `int` function and assigned to the variable `a`.
7. Call the `generate_series` function with the input value `a` and store the returned series of numbers in the variable `series`.
8. Use the `print` function to display the output. The series of numbers is converted to a comma-separated string using the `join` function and `map` to convert each number to a string. The string is preceded by the label "Output:" for clarity.

This process follows a similar flow for different input values of `a`. The code generates a series of odd numbers up to the given input value `a` and displays it as the output.



Problem-4:

Step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Define the function `get_multiples_count(numbers)` with `numbers` as the input parameter. This function will calculate the count of numbers in the given list that are multiples of each number in the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
2. Initialize an empty dictionary called `multiples_count` to store the count of numbers that are multiples of each number in the range.
3. Start a `for` loop that iterates over each number `i` in the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
4. Within the loop, calculate the count of numbers in the input list that are multiples of the current number `i`. This is done using a generator expression with `sum`. The expression `num % i == 0` checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the expression evaluates to `True` and contributes to the count.
5. Assign the count to the corresponding key `i` in the `multiples_count` dictionary.
6. After the loop finishes, return the `multiples_count` dictionary as the output of the function.
7. Outside the function, create a list called `input_list` with the given numbers [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30].
8. Call the `get_multiples_count` function with `input_list` as the argument. The function will calculate the count of multiples for each number in the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
9. Assign the result to the variable `output`.
10. Print the output with a descriptive message using the `print` function.

That's it! The code will execute these steps and provide the output: a dictionary with the count of numbers in `input_list` that are multiples of each number in the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
